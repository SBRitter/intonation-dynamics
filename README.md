# Software for manuscript "The dynamics of intonation: categorical and continuous variation in an attractor-based model"

This repository contains the software and data for the analyses and simulations of the manuscript "The dynamics of intonation: categorical and continuous variation in an attractor-based model" by Simon Ritter, Doris MÃ¼cke and Martine Grice. The software models the intonation data of the study, i.e. nuclear pitch accents characterised by tonal onglide, using a dynamic system with two attractors. The central piece of the repository is the R script which should also be the starting point to run the modelling. The actual simulations of the dynamic system are run by the C++ program that gets called by the R script. The onglide data of 27 native German speakers are stored in the csv files.

How to make it work (on a Mac):

1. Clone git repository: ```git clone https://github.com/SBRitter/intonation-dynamics```

2. Change to project folder: ```cd intonation-dynamics```

3. Open R Script. Make sure you keep all files (R script, compiled simulation program and csv data files) in one directory.

4. Install required R dependencies if you do not have them already
