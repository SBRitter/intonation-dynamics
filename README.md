# Software for paper "The dynamics of intonation: categorical and continuous variation in an attractor-based model"

This repository contains the software and data for the analyses and simulations of the manuscript "The dynamics of intonation: categorical and continuous variation in an attractor-based model" by Simon Roessig, Doris MÃ¼cke and Martine Grice published in PLOS ONE (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216859). The software models the intonation data of the study, i.e. nuclear pitch accents characterised by tonal onglide, using a dynamic system with two attractors. The central piece of the repository is the R script which should also be the starting point to run the modelling. The actual simulations of the dynamic system are run by the C++ program that gets called by the R script. The onglide data of 27 native German speakers are stored in the csv files. The centrepiece is the R script modelling.R. The main directory of the project has to be the current working directory in the R session when running the script.

Probably does not work on windows without tweaking. In case of problems, please write to ritter.simon(at)uni-koeln.de.
